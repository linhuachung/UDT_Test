    * Strong Points:
    1. Clarity: The sequence diagram provides a clear visual representation of the interaction between components/systems.
    2. Structured Approach: It outlines the necessary steps involved in saving, updating, and merging products data.
    3. Error Handling: The diagram includes basic error handling with the "alt" and "else" constructs to handle cases where products exist or do not exist in the database.
    4. Database Interaction: It clearly depicts the interaction between our system and the database for saving, updating, and merging data.

    * Weak Points:
    1. Real-time Data Handling: The diagram doesn't explicitly address how real-time data updates from the third-party API are handled every hour. It assumes a single request for the latest data.
    2. Concurrency: It doesn't address potential issues related to concurrent access to the database, especially in scenarios where multiple instances of the system are running simultaneously.
    3. Error Recovery: While basic error handling is included, there's no detailed consideration of error recovery mechanisms or handling of exceptional scenarios.
    4. Optimization: The diagram doesn't address potential optimizations such as batch processing or incremental updates to minimize database load.

    * Improvements:
    1. Real-time Data Handling: Incorporate a mechanism to continuously fetch real-time data updates from the third-party API at regular intervals (e.g., every hour) and update the database accordingly.
    2. Concurrency Control: Implement proper concurrency control mechanisms such as locking or optimistic concurrency control to handle concurrent database access.
    3. Error Handling and Recovery: Enhance error handling mechanisms to handle various error scenarios gracefully and implement recovery strategies where applicable.
    4. Optimization Techniques: Explore optimization techniques such as batch processing or incremental updates to improve efficiency and reduce database load, especially when dealing with large volumes of data.

title Authentication and Authorization Flow

User [icon: user] > Auth Service [icon: lock]: Request login
activate User
Auth Service > Database [icon: database]: Validate credentials
alt [label: if credentials valid] {
    Auth Service > User: Login success & auth token
    activate Auth Service
    User > User: Store auth state
    deactivate User
    loop [label: until logout] {
        User > Auth Service: Request resource access
        alt [label: if token valid] {
            Auth Service > Resource Service [icon: server]: Check permissions
            opt [label: if Customer] {
                Resource Service > Database: Read Customer data
                Resource Service > User: Customer data
            }
            opt [label: if Agency] {
                Resource Service > Database: CRUD Agency data
                Resource Service > User: Agency data response
            }
            opt [label: if Admin] {
                Resource Service > Database: Read all data
                Resource Service > User: Admin data response
            }
        }
        else [label: if token invalid] {
            Auth Service > User: Request re-authentication
            break
        }
    }
    User > Auth Service: Request logout
    Auth Service > User: Logout success
    deactivate Auth Service
}
else [label: if credentials invalid] {
    Auth Service > User: Login failure
    deactivate User
}



2.

    * Strong Points:
    1. Clarity: The sequence diagram effectively illustrates the flow of actions between actors and the authentication system.
    2. Role-based Authorization: It clearly shows the different actions each type of user (Customer, Agency, Admin) can take and how they are authorized.
    3. Interaction: It demonstrates the interaction between the actors and the authentication system, highlighting the authentication and authorization processes.
    4. Security Awareness: It emphasizes the importance of authorization and access control in the system.

    * Weak Points:
    1. Simplicity: The sequence diagram lacks details regarding the specific authentication mechanisms used (e.g., username/password, tokens, etc.).
    2. Scope: It focuses solely on authentication and authorization, excluding other aspects such as session management, encryption, etc.
    3. Dynamic Behavior: It doesn't capture dynamic scenarios such as authentication failures, session timeouts, or concurrent user interactions.
    4. Error Handling: Error handling and exceptional cases (e.g., unauthorized access attempts) are not addressed.

    * Improvements:
    1. Detailed Authentication Process: Provide a more detailed depiction of the authentication process, including specific mechanisms and protocols used (e.g., OAuth, JWT).
    2. Include Error Handling: Add error handling scenarios to illustrate how the system handles authentication failures, unauthorized access attempts, etc.
    3. Expand Scope: Consider expanding the diagram to include other security-related processes such as session management, data encryption, and secure communication protocols.
    4. Dynamic Scenarios: Incorporate dynamic scenarios to show how the system reacts to changes in user behavior, such as session expiration or concurrent access.
    5. Feedback Loops: Add feedback loops to indicate actions taken based on the outcome of authentication and authorization checks.
